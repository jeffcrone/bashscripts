# bashscripts
Some bash scripts I think are useful. Most if not all of these are probably designed to be run in Linux, specifically my computer (currently) running Ubuntu, so your results may vary when running these. 
Also, I'll try to (at least mostly) always keep them in working order but no promises.

This might be a good page to reference when creating these:
